#### Security Note

It is absolutely safe to use my fork (at the time of me writing this), however, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to keep my fork up to date with all bug- and security-fixes of the original branch (<https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick>) in the future. I will check the main branch regularly and merge changes, but it is not my focus to be a maintainer. This means that it's quite possible that there will be security updates in the main branch, which I will not integrate in my fork immediately, or at all. At the moment, it should be pretty safe to use. Thanks for considering this fork!
